<h1>Meme Generator</h1>
<p>This was a <em>'capstone'</em> react project from the FreeCodeCamp Learn React videos by Bob Ziroll.</p>

<p>I built this project 3 times in order to gain a firmer graps on the concepts of React, including form submission, event handling and state management.</p>

<p>One small piece of additional functionality includes being about to toggle the font color via a checkbox. I found this feature useful when a dark image is randomly chosen</p>
<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>On component mount, an array is populated with meme background images. This is done by hitting the <a href="https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes">Get Meme Api</a>. When the generate button event is triggered, a new random background is populated and displayed. Text inputs populate the text on screen by updating state and displaying the value as a controlled component</p>
